### Dataset Description

We are using the UK Data Service PROTECT data set (Halligan, 2023) that captures measures exploring the role of trauma specific behaviours and parenting style in facilitating child psychological adjustment. The data set includes self-reported questionnaires of children and parents who have experienced a traumatic event, including:

-   Child Post-trauma Behaviour Questionnaire

-   Child Post-trauma Cognition Inventory Questionnaire

-   Parent Trauma Response Questionnaire

The collection contains data from three time points:

-   *T1:* Within **six weeks** of the traumatic event

-   *T2:* **Three months** after the traumatic event

-   *T3:* **Six months** after the traumatic event

### Developing the Research Question

We're examining factors that predict hot memory encoding of traumatic events in children. The project is grounded in the premise that traumatic experiences activate a psychological alarm response, leading to heightened amygdala activity and suppressed hippocampal function.

This neurological profile contributes to non-optimal encoding, in which emotional, cognitive, sensory and physiological aspects of the event (hot memories) are stored without their temporal and spatial context (cold memory). Such disturbances may underpin subjective experiences like flashbacks.

### Hypotheses

**H1:** Higher levels of maladaptive child beliefs will be associated with greater hot memory encoding of the traumatic event

**H2:** Higher levels of child maladaptive behaviours will be associated with greater hot memory encoding

**H3:** Child beliefs will indirectly influence hot memory encoding through their impact on child behaviours

**H4:** Parental trauma-related beliefs will be associated with more maladaptive child beliefs

**H5:** Parental trauma-related beliefs will influence child beliefs indirectly through their effect on parental behaviours
